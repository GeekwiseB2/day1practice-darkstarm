    <p>I heard about geekwise through a friend of mine who took the classes and went on to become a developer down in LA. After taking the first class, I was hooked and knew that this was the line of work I wanted to be in. Now it's just time to have open ears and listen to those who are more versed in what I'm trying to learn.</p>
